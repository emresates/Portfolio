## My Portfolio Page

### I thought I needed a portfolio page and designed a nice one. 

### When you hover the home button that appears on the main page, the other menu options open. If you pull the mouse away from the buttons or area, the menu closes back. On the left side is the about me and contact page, and on the right side is the my projects and work experience page. 

### About me page has the languages I use and information about me. On the contact page, there are ways and form you can use if you want to contact me. But form is not functional. 

### In the projects section, you will see a few projects I have made, the languages I used while doing the project, github and live links. A nice video on the my experience page welcomes you.
